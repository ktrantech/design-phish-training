<h2>Step 1. First, let‚Äôs have a look at the results of the phishing campaign.

</h2>

- This table helps you to identify which teams appear to be more likely to fall for a phishing email than others.

<h2>Step 2. Which teams performed poorly in the phishing simulation?</h2>

- HR Team & Marketing Team performed poorly in the simulation and should receive further training.


   <h2>Step 3. Create a short training presentation
 </h2>
   
- Now that you've analyzed the results, it's time to create a short presentation (3-5 slides) providing some awareness and training materials for the two teams that appear to be most susceptible. This will help us improve the security awareness of the teams that performed poorly in this campaign.


üì£ Remember that employees at times view training as boring - so try to make the presentation clear, concise and easy to understand. Try to educate employees on what phishing is, as well as provide examples of tactics often used. Use any resources you choose, the more creative, the better! üì£

   <h2>Step 4. Example Phishing Email</h2>

   - There are many ways you could have attempted this task, as phishing emails come in all shapes & sizes. Below you'll find one example of an improved phishing email - take note of some of the improvements made
